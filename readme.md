# Note-Taking tool (audio)

This is a Web application developed to facilitate people’s note-taking process during informal learning. 

It is also a tool used for collecting note-taking data from participants of this project. 

Data are analyzed and evaluated to answer insightful questions such as “How does note-taking modality impact reflection overtime in informal learning context”, etc.
